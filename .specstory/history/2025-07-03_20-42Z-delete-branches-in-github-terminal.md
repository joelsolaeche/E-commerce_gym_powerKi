_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking how to delete a main branch and other branches from the terminal in GitHub. Let me think about this...

There are a few things to consider here:

1. They want to delete branches, including the main branch
2. They want to do this from the terminal
3. They mentioned "GitHub page" but I think they mean from the terminal (not the GitHub web interface)

However, there are some important things to note:

1. You typically can't delete the main/master branch directly because it's usually the default branch
2. If you want to delete the main branch, you'd typically need to:
   - First set another branch as the default branch on GitHub
   - Then delete the main branch
3. For other branches, you can delete them locally and remotely

Let me provide a comprehensive answer about how to delete branches both locally and remotely from the terminal.

I should also mention the risks and best practices around deleting branches, especially the main branch.</details></think>

I'll help you understand how to delete branches from the terminal, including the main branch. However, there are important considerations when deleting the main branch.

## Deleting Regular Branches

### Delete Local Branches
```bash
# Delete a local branch (branch must not be currently checked out)
git branch -d branch-name

# Force delete a local branch (even if it has unmerged changes)
git branch -D branch-name
```

### Delete Remote Branches
```bash
# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name

# Alternative syntax
git push origin :branch-name
```

## Deleting the Main Branch

**⚠️ Important:** You cannot directly delete the main/master branch if it's the default branch. Here's the process:

### Step 1: Create and Push a New Default Branch
```bash
# Create a new branch (e.g., 'develop' or 'main-new')
git checkout -b develop
git push origin develop
```

### Step 2: Change Default Branch on GitHub
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Branches** in the left sidebar
4. Change the default branch from `main` to your new branch (`develop`)
5. Click **Update** and confirm

### Step 3: Delete the Main Branch
```bash
# Now you can delete the main branch remotely
git push origin --delete main

# Delete it locally
git branch -d main
```

## Delete Multiple Branches at Once

### Delete Multiple Local Branches
```bash
# Delete multiple local branches
git branch -d branch1 branch2 branch3

# Force delete multiple branches
git branch -D branch1 branch2 branch3
```

### Delete Multiple Remote Branches
```bash
# Delete multiple remote branches
git push origin --delete branch1 branch2 branch3
```

## Useful Commands for Branch Management

### List All Branches
```bash
# List local branches
git branch

# List remote branches
git branch -r

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a
```

### Delete All Local Branches Except Current
```bash
# Delete all local branches except the current one
git branch | grep -v "^*" | xargs git branch -d
```

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **Backup First**: Always ensure you have backups of important code before deleting branches
2. **Check for Unmerged Changes**: Use `git branch --no-merged` to see branches with unmerged changes
3. **Team Communication**: If working with a team, communicate before deleting shared branches
4. **Default Branch**: You cannot delete the default branch without first changing it on GitHub

## Alternative: Archive Instead of Delete

If you're unsure about deleting, consider archiving the repository instead:
- Go to GitHub repository → Settings → scroll down to "Danger Zone" → Archive repository

Would you like me to help you with any specific branch deletions, or do you need clarification on any of these steps?
